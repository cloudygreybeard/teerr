.SH NAME
teerr \- copy standard input to standard output and standard error
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B teerr
reads data from the standard input and writes it unchanged
to both the standard output and the standard error (or an alternate
file descriptor if specified).
.PP
It is intended for use in pipelines where the value of a stream
must be preserved for further processing while also being visible
for logging or debugging.
.PP
.B teerr
writes only to file descriptors already present in the
process environment. It does not create files.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Print version information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Print usage information and exit.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I fd
File descriptor number to write to instead of stderr.

.SH EXAMPLES
Capture output in a variable while echoing it to standard error:
.PP
.RS
.nf
value=$(command | teerr)
.fi
.RE
.PP
Observe pipeline output without altering the pipeline:
.PP
.RS
.nf
generate | teerr | consume
.fi
.RE
.PP
Write to file descriptor 3 instead of stderr:
.PP
.RS
.nf
command | teerr 3
.fi
.RE
.SH RATIONALE
Shell pipelines obscure intermediate values.
.PP
.B teerr
exists to expose them at the moment they are produced,
without rewriting the pipeline or introducing temporary files.
.PP
It is equivalent to the shell construct:
.PP
.RS
.nf
tee >(cat >&2)
.fi
.RE
.PP
but requires fewer keystrokes and no subshell.
.SH EXIT STATUS

exits 0 on success.
A non-zero exit status indicates an I/O error.
